# Overview

This project is a 2D arcade-style game called NoteRunner, designed to help me strengthen my skills as a software engineer by building a fully functional interactive application. My goal with this project was to practice game-loop logic, sprite management, collision detection, audio integration, and state-based game design.

NoteRunner is a fast-paced music-themed game where the player controls a running character trying to catch falling musical notes. The player moves left and right to catch as many notes as possible while avoiding misses. As the player scores points, the game increases in difficulty: notes fall faster, they spawn more frequently, and the background music gradually accelerates to match the intensity of the gameplay. Missing too many notes ends the game.

I chose to develop this software to gain hands-on experience with Python game development, asset handling, real-time updates, and interactive design. This project helped me develop confidence in managing user input, game physics, and audio systems within a real application.

# Development Environment

Editor: Visual Studio Code

Runtime: Python 3.12

Language: Python

Main Libraries:

arcade – for window rendering, sprites, collisions, game loop, and audio

random – for generating random note positions

json – for saving and loading player data

os – for handling file paths

# Future Work

Here are improvements I plan to add in future versions:

--Add animated running sprites for smoother character movement

--Add sound effects for level-ups and game-over events

--Implement a difficulty selection menu

--Add different types of falling notes with bonus effects

--Improve the UI design for the HUD and menus

--Add background animations or parallax effects

--Create a high-score leaderboard
